# Eficode Open Data Task 2019

My solution to the [Eficode Open Data Task 2019](https://github.com/eficode/opendata-task-2019). I hadn't used react or node previously but since they were mentioned in the assignment, and I've been looking for a reason to, I tried them out. Solution can be found on [Heroku](https://young-oasis-45650.herokuapp.com/) (if still up). This project was never finalized, since I already got a job for the summer during making this.

## Directory structure
- `backend/` -- Koa backend connected to MongoDB database. REST API with one endpoint `/sensors` for GETting sensor data.
- `frontend/` -- React frontend using Material UI and Recharts.
